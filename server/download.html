<h2>LightWAVE backup files</h2>

<p>
This page contains links to two <b>temporary</b> directories where files are
kept for up to 10 days after you back them up from LightWAVE:

<dl>
<dt><a href="logs/">logs</a></dt>
<dd> This directory contains edit logs that you have backed up within the past
10 days.  Their names are formed from the names of the annotation files with
which they are associated.  For example, if you edited the qrs annotation set
for record <tt>slpdb/slp60</tt>, the associated edit log is
<tt>logs/slpdb-slp60.qrs.log</tt>.  Note that any '/' (path separator)
characters in the record name are replaced by '-' characters in the name of the
edit log.  Edit logs are text files.  After the first two lines (a header and an
empty line), each edit appears on a line of the log, in the same order in which
you made the edits (oldest first).  This order is opposite to the order in which
they can be displayed within LightWAVE (newest first).

<dt><a href="database/">database</a></dt>
<dd> This directory contains PhysioBank-compatible binary annotation
files that include your edits.  The annotation files are stored within
subdirectories that have the same structure as the PhysioBank data
archive.  For example, if you created a new annotation file for record
<tt>challenge/2013/set-b/b01</tt>, you will find it within
<tt>database/challenge/2013/set-b/</tt>, and its name will be <tt>b01.new</tt>
(or <tt>b01.new1</tt>, etc.).  If you edited an existing annotation file from
PhysioBank, its name will have an appended underscore, to distinguish it from
the original.  For example, if you edited <tt>mitdb/100.atr</tt>, your edited
version will be stored in <tt>database/mitdb/</tt>, and its name will
be <tt>100.atr_</tt>.
</dl>

<p>
<b>To preserve these files it is essential to copy them to permanent
storage!</b>
Transfer them to another location within 10 days of backing them up here.
After 10 days, they are automatically deleted and cannot be recovered.

<p>
Note, however, that LightWAVE preserves the edit logs in local storage (on your
computer) indefinitely, and the annotation files can be recreated from the edit
logs.  If your backup files are deleted from this server, you can simply back
them up again if you have not deleted them from your browser's local storage.
